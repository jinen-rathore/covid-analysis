# Abstract
The Covid Pandemic has left the world in disarray. It caught the world by surprise and
ended up drastically affecting the lives of every human being on the planet. We wished to
apply data analytics methods to understand and study the data - OWiD(Our World in Data)
realtime covid dataset - to analyse and draw trends and factors that led to the widespread of
the virus. Doing so, will allow us to identify key factors and create a real time model that we
can analyse and research, and will help the world prevent such a devastating effect of a
virus from happening again by keeping the identified factors at bay.
For the purpose of this project, we have used the covid data from the following countries:
Australia(AUS), Cuba(CUB), India(IND), France(FRA), South Africa(ZAF) and the United
States of America(USA).

# Motivation
The outbreak of COVID-19 Coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV-2, has created a calamitous situation
throughout the world. It has taken millions of lives and still continues to be a hindrance to most
countries around the world. The world is in dire need for concrete solutions to put an end to this
pandemic. Hence our team aims to create various models of prediction of Covid-19 data so that we
can understand and plan what to do when similar outbreaks happen.

# Problem Statement and Objectives
Following the identification of the new coronavirus COVID-19 in December 2019 and its global
spread, large epidemics have ensued around the world. In response to the rising numbers of cases
and deaths and to preserve health systems, countries have implemented measures to control their
epidemics. Machine Learning and Data Analytics can be deployed very effectively to track the
disease, predict growth of the epidemic and design strategies and policies to manage its spread.
Data Analytics and ML has been applied to predict the threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide.
We aim to analyse the ample data available to form a model for the outbreak of COVID-19 and then
use that model to forecast future outbreaks of disease and how we can best deal with it.

# Methodology
In our project we are working with owid-covid-19 dataset that provides the real time data for various
attributes which include number of cases, number of deaths, tests, vaccinations taken, stringency
index and so on. Data Analytics and ML has been applied to predict the threat of COVID-19 in
countries worldwide. Then we have explored the data for critical attributes which are relevant for our
case of study and based our work around it. We have applied the data preprocessing techniques
which include data cleaning, data imputation & data enhancement to improve the quality of the
dataset and to draw accurate and better conclusions. After having applied the pre-processing
techniques, we have implemented some of the popular regression models which include Linear
Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Autoregressive Integrated
Moving Average to analyse the past trends and predict the future trends by training the models.
After completion of the above, we aim to create a model that analyses what happened during
COVID-19 so that it can be studied and researched to prevent future outbreaks.

# Models Applied
- Linear Regression
- Multiple Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
